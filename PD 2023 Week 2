-- In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string
-- Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving bank account
-- Add a field for the Country Code
      -- Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
-- Create the IBAN as above
      -- Hint: watch out for trying to combine string fields with numeric fields - check data types
-- Remove unnecessary fields
