-- For the transactions file:
    -- Filter the transactions to just look at DSB (help)
        -- These will be transactions that contain DSB in the Transaction Code field
    -- Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values
    -- Change the date to be the quarter (help)
    --1.Sum the transaction values for each quarter and for each Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person) (help)
-- For the targets file:
    -- Pivot the quarterly targets so we have a row for each Type of Transaction and each Quarter (help)
    -- Rename the fields
    -- Remove the 'Q' from the quarter field and make the data type numeric (help)
-- Join the two datasets together (help)
    -- You may need more than one join clause!
-- Remove unnecessary fields
-- Calculate the Variance to Target for each row
